# Official Weasel profile sources

`config/official-weasel` adapts the shared Chinese and smart English sources to official Weasel 0.17.4 and its x64 librime 1.13.1 runtime.

The profile retains existing Chinese spelling, correction, composition and native learning, and the English recall index, completion, case handling and native word learning. Candidate layout and installation samples use the official frontend interfaces.

The general dictionaries and reproducible data generation are documented in [base sources](base-dictionaries.md). [English forms](english-extensions-sources.md), [case evidence](english-case-forms-sources.md), [compact model](luna-compact-model-sources.md) and [OpenCC resources](shared-config-sources.md) retain their component notices. Optional vocabulary uses the shared [DLC source recipe](../dlc-sources.md).

Original adaptation code is GPL-3.0-only. Tools retain their [upstream attribution](tools-sources.md). `profile-manifest.json` records supplied profile files and source hashes. The tests use fresh synthetic directories and fixed inputs; see [Build](../BUILD.md).
